Real Time Face Mask Detetction System

After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19, there arises a severe need of protection mechanisms, face mask being the primary one. 
The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on live streaming video as well as on images.
Real Time Face Mask Detection system is expected for checking that people faces are masked in regulated areas or not.
Face detection is a key area in the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
To perform this task, a large dataset of masked faces is necessary for training deep learning models towards detecting people wearing masks and those not wearing masks.
Besides, many people are not correctly wearing their masks due to bad practices, bad behaviors or vulnerability of individuals (e.g., children, old people).
